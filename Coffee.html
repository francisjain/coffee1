                        <strong>Coffee</strong> is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of
                        berries from certain
                        Coffea species. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product:
                        unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a
                        consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into a powder and typically steeped in hot
                        water
                        before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.<br>
                        Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans,
                        primarily
                        due to its caffeine content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world,[4] and can be
                        prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or
                        already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is
                        common.
                        Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste. It may be
                        served
                        with coffee cake or another sweet dessert like doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells
                        prepared coffee beverages is known as a coffee shop (not to be confused with Dutch coffeeshops
                        selling cannabis).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Clinical research indicates that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial as a
                        stimulant in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption reduces
                        the
                        risk of some diseases, although some of the long-term studies are of questionable
                        credibility.[5]

                        The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking as the modern beverage appears in modern-day
                        Yemen
                        from the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and
                        brewed in a manner similar to how it is now prepared for drinking.[2] The Yemenis procured the
                        coffee beans from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries, and began
                        cultivation.
                        By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later
                        spreading to Europe.
                    </p>

                    <p> It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common.
                        Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste. It may be
                        served
                        with coffee cake or another sweet dessert like doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells
                        prepared coffee beverages is known as a coffee shop (not to be confused with Dutch coffeeshops
                        selling cannabis).

                        The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are C. arabica and C. robusta. Coffee plants are
                        cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast
                        Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa. As of 2018, Brazil was the leading grower of coffee
                        beans, producing 35% of the world total.[6] Coffee is a major export commodity as the leading
                        legal
                        agricultural export for numerous countries.[7] It is one of the most valuable commodities
                        exported
                        by developing countries. Green, unroasted coffee is the most traded agricultural commodity, and
                        the
                        coffee trade is the most traded commodity second only to petroleum.[8] Despite the sales of
                        coffee
                        reaching billions of dollars, those actually producing the beans are disproportionately living
                        in
                        poverty.[9] Critics also point to the coffee industry's negative impact on the environment and
                        the
                        clearing of land for coffee-growing and water use. The environmental costs and wage disparity of
                        farmers is causing the market for fair trade and organic coffee to expand.[10]

                <p><strong>C O F F E E &nbsp; P R O C E S S I N G :</strong> A coffee plant usually starts to produce
                    flowers three to four years after it is planted,[2] and it
                    is from these flowers that the fruits of the plant (commonly known as coffee cherries) appear, with
                    the first useful harvest possible around five years after planting. The cherries ripen around eight
                    months after the emergence of the flower, by changing color from green to red, and it is at this
                    time that they should be harvested. In most coffee-growing countries, there is one major harvest a
                    year; though in countries like Colombia, where there are two flowerings a year, there is a main and
                    secondary crop, the main one April to June and a smaller one in November to December.[3]

                    In most countries, the coffee crop is picked by hand, a labor-intensive and difficult process,
                    though in places like Brazil, where the landscape is relatively flat and the coffee fields are
                    immense, the process has been mechanized.[3] Whether picked by hand or by machine, all coffee is
                    harvested in one of two ways:</p><br><br>
